## Github Finder

- This app allows you to search and find Github users.
- Built with react, and styled with Tailwind & Daisy UI.
- This app is hosted on Vercel.
- I am using the Github API to find users.
- I built this app with help from [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/ 'Brad Traversy Udemy'). Watch his videos and tutorials to build apps like this.
